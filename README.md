# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

I was given the starter code for this project from Lighthouse Labs and then I build upon it to practice my HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, also Node and Express back-end skills.

## Final Product
The tweet submission form includes error handling and form validation where if there's nothing in the textarea or if it exceeds 140 character limit, the user is shown an error feedback. Otherwise, the tweet will post successfully!
It is also support resizing the viewport.
